# Classification-of-Dog-and-Cat-Images
CNNs utilize convolutional layers to capture local patterns and features, pooling layers to extract important information, and fully connected layers for classification. The CNN is trained on a labeled dataset of dog and cat images, minimizing a loss function to learn discriminative features. The trained CNN is evaluated on training set.
