# Classification-of-Dog-and-Cat-Images
CNNs utilize convolutional layers to capture local patterns and features, pooling layers to extract important information, and fully connected layers for classification. The CNN is trained on a labeled dataset of dog and cat images, minimizing a loss function to learn discriminative features. The trained CNN is evaluated on training set.
Dog-cat classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a popular and effective method for automatically categorizing images as either dogs or cats. CNNs excel in image recognition tasks by utilizing their ability to capture and extract meaningful features from the input data.

The process begins by collecting a labeled dataset containing images of dogs and cats. This dataset is then divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the CNN, while the testing set is utilized to evaluate its performance.

The CNN architecture typically consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input images, capturing local patterns and features. Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions and extract important information. Fully connected layers connect the extracted features to the final classification layer.

During training, the CNN learns to recognize distinguishing features that differentiate dogs from cats by minimizing a loss function. This involves forward propagation, where the images pass through the layers, and backward propagation, where gradients are calculated to update the network's parameters.

To enhance performance and prevent overfitting, techniques such as data augmentation and regularization methods like dropout are employed.

After training, the CNN is tested on the separate testing set to assess its accuracy. The final classification layer produces predicted probabilities for each class, and a threshold is applied to determine the predicted label.

In summary, dog-cat classification using CNNs is a powerful and widely used method for accurately identifying dogs and cats in images. It leverages the capabilities of CNNs to automatically learn and extract relevant features from the input data, making it an essential technique in the field of computer vision.
